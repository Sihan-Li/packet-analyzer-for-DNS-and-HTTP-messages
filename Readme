	In this project, i implemented a project to analyze the HTTP and DNS messages, i used python pcapy to implement it.
I'll get ethernet packets by using findalldevs and open_lives functions , and then what i want to print out is the mac address, ip address, and TCP/UDP port for both source and destination.
	(1)Firstly i get the ethernet packet and input it into parse_packet function, and in this functions, 
	(2)we then parse the ethernet header , take the mac address out, and then peel it off,
	(3)then parse IP header , take the IP address out, take the transport_layer protocol out and then peel it off, 

	(4)if the transport layer uses TCP, we parse TCP header, extract port number from it and peel it off, 
	(5)lastly we find the http message type in the http content.

	(6)if the transport layer uses UDP, we parse UDP header , also extract the port number and then peel UDP header off,
	(7) then in the rest of dns content we can unpack it and find its message type.

	(8) lastly we print it out, then we get what we want.

	It's like multiple boxes overlayed, we take turns to extract what we want and peel off this layer until the last layer.
